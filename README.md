Title - Optimal Route Decider
This project aims to refine the route finder of Google Maps based on current and future flood possibilities. There are many cities which are frequently flooded due to rains and high tides during the monsoon period. The project collects data from various open available sources on the weather situation, identification of low lying areas and compares it with past data to identify probable flooded locations. This is then used to find a better route for the requested destination. Thus it helps commuters to optimise their travelling better.
